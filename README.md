# OpenSpineConsortium · Student_Projects

Student research projects on the consortium's open datasets. This public repository holds
everything reusable: onboarding, templates, tools, the demo study and the ideas list. The
projects themselves live in a private repository,
[OpenSpineConsortium/Projects](https://github.com/OpenSpineConsortium/Projects), cloned
inside this one as `projects/`, so a proposal is reviewed by pull request among
collaborators and stays private until it is published.

**Start here:** [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) is seven steps: three installs,
clone this repository, open it in VS Code, type `claude` and then `/onboard`. Claude reads
the `CLAUDE.md` at the root of this repository and does the rest with you: the grid
connection, the environment and the dataset on the grid (as jobs), the demo study, and a
project chosen from [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) and written up as a proposal.
The three grid steps that need your university identity (account, Google Authenticator,
SSH key) are spelled out there. The long-form version, with the reasons behind each step,
is the [OSC Primer](https://openspineconsortium.github.io/onboarding/).

## How a project moves

| step | who | where |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Read the primer and run the demo study | you | `examples/pelvic_width_dimorphism/` |
| 2. Write a one-page proposal from the template | you | `templates/proposal_template.md` |
| 3. Open a pull request adding `<lastname>_<topic>/proposal.md` in the private Projects repository (`projects/`) | you | GitHub, using the PR template; `/new-project` does it |
| 4. Review, questions, revisions in the PR thread | mentor and you | GitHub (private) |
| 5. Approval, merge, ClickUp invitation to the email in your PR | mentor | ClickUp |
| 6. Work in your project folder on a branch; milestones tracked in ClickUp | you | `projects/` and ClickUp |
| 7. Results, figure code and a write-up in the same folder; final PR | you | `projects/` |

The worked example, [examples/proposal_example/proposal.md](examples/proposal_example/proposal.md),
is the proposal every new one should imitate.

## Rules that keep this repository usable

- **No imaging data in git.** CT and label volumes stay on the grid or your disk; `.gitignore`
  blocks `*.nii.gz`. Commit code, small CSVs of derived measurements, figures and text.
- **Every figure has a script that regenerates it** from the released data, with the
  environment pinned in `environment.yml`.
- **One project, one folder, one branch per piece of work.** Never commit to `main` directly.
- **Cite the dataset** you used, by its DOI, in anything you write or present.
- **Nothing heavy runs on the login node, and job scripts are files, never heredocs.**
  `templates/CLAUDE.md` says why; `tools/grid.sh` makes the right thing the easy thing.
